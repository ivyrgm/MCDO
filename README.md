# An Online Ordering System with Customization for MCDO Furniture

This was our third year thesis project. It was originally made using ASP.NET, but on our second semester, it was required to use HTML, CSS, and PHP. So I had to start from scratch, and the Customization feature was not as complete as I made it using ASP.NET. The other feature which is the Ordering, is working.


MCDO Furniture is a company that sells ready-made furnitures and they also accepts customization of your desired furnitures. They are located at Orion, Bataan.
